## Hadoop Cluster Deployment

This script deploys a cluster with `Apache Hadoop 3.4.x` in fully distributed mode using `Docker` containers as the underlying infrastructure. This setup is primarily intended for teaching and experimentation, but it may also be suitable for scalable data processing workloads in controlled environments.

### üóÇÔ∏è Architecture

The cluster consists of **one master node** and a configurable number of **worker nodes**, deployed over a custom `Docker` network.

- **Master Node**: `hadoop-master` ‚Äî responsible for coordinating the cluster, managing resources (via YARN), and serving as the Hadoop Master and HDFS NameNode.
- **Worker Nodes**: `hadoop-worker-<id>` ‚Äî replicated containers acting as Workers, HDFS DataNodes, and YARN NodeManagers, where `<id>` denotes the worker instance ID.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Resource Management and Services

The cluster uses **YARN** for resource scheduling and **HDFS** for distributed file storage. Here are the key services on each node:

#### Master Node (`hadoop-master`)

- **ResourceManager** (YARN)
- **NameNode** (HDFS)
- **Exposed Ports**:
  - `9870` ‚Äì HDFS Web UI
  - `8088` ‚Äì YARN ResourceManager UI

#### Worker Nodes (`hadoop-worker-<id>`)

- **DataNode** (HDFS)
- **NodeManager** (YARN)


### :rocket: How to build and run

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All cluster parameters ‚Äî such as the default user credentials, resource allocation (e.g., memory and CPU limits), number of worker nodes, and other deployment-specific settings ‚Äî are configurable via the `.env` file. This file is the primary configuration source for the cluster setup.

‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (Recommended): Before starting, it is advised to pre-download Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark by running the `download.sh` script. This step will speed up the build process.

#### To build and run this option:
```
docker compose build && docker compose up 
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: It is advised to use `Docker Compose 1.18.0` or higher to ensure compatibility.

### :bulb: Tips

#### Accessing the Master Node

To access the master node, run the following command:
```
docker exec -it hadoop-master bash
```
